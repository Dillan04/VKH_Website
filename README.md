# VKH_Website

## This is a small website I created for a current business that provides healthcare solutions to public and private hospitals. This business provides simple yet perfect solutions to enhance healthcare.
## I used basic technologies like HTML and CSS to create this. Images were not included due to size restrictions, but the general flow of the website is there. You can upload your own images and rename them to use them as a template. You can also change the font styling, colors, and layout for personalization.
## This is a slight update to the Version I posted earlier.
